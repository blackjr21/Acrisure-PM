## Todo Format Guidelines

All todos in this file must follow this exact format:

```markdown
### [Program/Project] Task description
- **Due:** YYYY-MM-DD (or TBD)
- **Priority:** High/Medium/Low
- **Status:** Not Started/In Progress/Blocked/Completed
- **Notes:** Additional context
- **Source:** [Path/To/Source/File.md](Path/To/Source/File.md)
- **Created:** YYYY-MM-DD
```

**Required Fields:**
- **Due:** Always include (use "TBD" if unknown)
- **Priority:** High/Medium/Low
- **Status:** Not Started/In Progress/Blocked/Completed
- **Notes:** Context, blockers, or details
- **Source:** Clickable link to source file (meeting, status report, project todos, etc.)
- **Created:** Date when task was added to MASTER-TODOS.md (YYYY-MM-DD format)

**Escalation Rule:**
- Tasks with "Due: TBD" that are 3+ days old (based on Created date) should be escalated
- Flag these as needing immediate attention to assign due dates
