---

## TLDR
- [DECISION] Calvin Williams Jr. onboarded as TPM allocated to AI Engineering team, reporting to Sletvana but working closely with Nitin (AI Engineering lead) as primary stakeholder
- [STRUCTURE] Operating in matrixed organization: 4 horizontal teams (AI Scientists, AI Engineers, Responsible AI, AI Program) supporting multiple business solution verticals
- [PRIORITY] Three immediate focus areas: (1) Project management & JIRA ticket tracking for AI Engineering, (2) Cross-team dependency management with AI Scientists team, (3) Third-party collaboration (e.g., OCI infrastructure)
- [RISK] High expectations and pressure due to prior lack of TPM coverage; multiple stakeholders await Calvin's support with open gaps
- [DEPENDENCY] Will work closely with Madhu (TPM for AI Scientists team, only 2 weeks tenure) to define boundaries and manage cross-team initiatives
- [BLOCKER] AI Scientists team currently blocked on OCI virtual machine access—unclear ownership, falls under Nitin's engineering area

## Risks
- [RISK] Extremely high expectations from multiple stakeholders due to prior TPM coverage gap; Sletvana heard Calvin's name repeatedly as anticipated solution to existing ownership voids—may create unrealistic pressure for immediate impact
- [BLOCKER] AI Scientists team blocked on OCI virtual machine access; unclear ownership across Engineering (Nitin), infrastructure, and third-party teams—requires Calvin to lead resolution process
- [RISK] Lack of mature JIRA tracking and ticket accountability in AI Engineering team; current state described as "mess" with unclear processes—may take 2-3 weeks to establish clarity
- [DEPENDENCY] Success heavily dependent on collaboration with Madhu (AI Scientists TPM), who has only 2 weeks tenure and limited understanding of boundaries; both TPMs must define overlapping responsibilities together
- [RISK] Sam (prior project manager for Nitin's area) described as having "unstructured approach" and not mature TPM—transition from her may lack quality documentation or clear handoff
- [DEPENDENCY] AI Scientists team (Christine's area) has multiple dependencies on AI Engineering team that are currently not covered or tracked—creates urgent cross-team coordination needs
- [RISK] Organizational complexity: matrixed structure with horizontal resource owners and vertical business areas creates potential for unclear accountability and competing priorities
- [RISK] Technical knowledge gaps may hinder effectiveness; Calvin needs to ramp up on infrastructure (OCI platform migration) and domain-specific AI/ML engineering concepts
- [RISK] Many team members are new (Richard, Corey, Madhu)—limited institutional knowledge across the organization compounds onboarding challenges

**Calvin's Three Primary Responsibilities:**

**1. Project Management & Ticket Tracking for AI Engineering:**
- Ensure all AI Engineering work is accountable, tracked, prioritized, and structured
- Create and maintain JIRA tickets for all Engineering team efforts
- Current state: Unclear maturity of processes; other teams struggle to create/track tickets for Nitin's team
- AI Engineering has morning sprints, but unclear if JIRA board exists or how triaging works
- Target: 2-3 weeks to achieve high-level understanding of hierarchy and priorities
- Key support: Abrar (Senior PM) will help with JIRA board creation and structure

**2. Cross-Team Dependency Management (Engineering ↔ Scientists):**
- "Urgent" priority due to Christine's team having many dependencies on Nitin's team that are currently uncovered
- Example blocker: AI Scientists team lacks access to OCI virtual machines (infrastructure under Nitin's area but unclear single owner)
- Requires leading cross-functional processes even when ownership spans multiple teams
- Limited number of initiatives with open intersections between Engineering and Scientists teams
- Work closely with Madhu to figure out division of responsibilities and joint ownership
- Sletvana described this as "thought piece" (challenging/complex)

**3. Third-Party & External Collaborations:**
- Example: OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) team—Claritev is migrating to OCI platform
- May require technical depth and understanding of infrastructure concepts
- Represents "incoming bloggers" (likely "blockers") and six-seven collaboration points
- Calvin may need technical onboarding/training on infrastructure topics

**Key Discussion Points:**

- **Role Positioning:** Calvin described as "bridge between Nitin and other people" to help bring structure, organization, and external visibility to Engineering team's work
- **Value Proposition:** Organizing Engineering work internally + managing external dependencies (especially with Scientists team) = quick wins to establish authority and demonstrate value
- **Technical Knowledge:** Sletvana recommends clarifying with Nitin what technical areas Calvin should develop depth in—technical understanding will support success but role is TPM, not engineer
- **Support Model:** Calvin requested end-of-day questions and "escalate quick and often" approach rather than daily scheduled check-ins; Sletvana agreed and committed to fast response times
- **Organizational Maturity:** Very new team, many recent hires, building new platform—"a lot of mess" but Sletvana emphasizes support and shared journey
- **Pressure Context:** Sletvana openly acknowledged hearing Calvin's name repeatedly as anticipated solution to gaps, wants to ensure expectations are managed and Calvin is supported

**Technical Details:**
- **Infrastructure:** Migration to OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) in progress
- **AI/ML Platform:** Building new platform (details not specified)
- **Tools:** JIRA for ticket tracking (needs to be established/structured for AI Engineering)
- **Processes:** Agile sprints (morning stand-ups for Engineering team)

**Calvin's Personal Notes (End of Transcript):**
Calvin identified future automation/tooling opportunities:
- Build AI agent for meeting notes documentation
- Build agent for stakeholder chart creation and maintenance
- Build agent for task tracking and management
- Future state: Connect these agents to Motion (task management tool)
